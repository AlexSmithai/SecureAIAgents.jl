Sphinx is a decentralized AI framework for Web3, empowering autonomous agents with swarm intelligence and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. Inspired by statistical physics and machine learning principles (similar to projects like Sphinx.jl), Sphinx enables agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate complex systems in Web3 environments. Agents collaborate, make decisions, and interact with blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, NEAR) using advanced techniques like game theory, reinforcement learning, and secure communication via TEEs and ZKPs. Sphinx is ideal for applications in DeFi, decentralized governance, and educational simulations.
As MCP is described as the "TCP/IP of AI Agents" in Web3 discussions, Sphinx provides a robust platform for developers, researchers, and educators to explore intelligent, decentralized systems.

Features
Swarm Intelligence: Agents collaborate using decentralized communication protocols, leading to emergent behaviors like consensus formation and market trend prediction.

Model Context Protocol (MCP): Integrates MCP for seamless agent interoperability, enabling context-aware decision-making with blockchain data.

Multi-Chain Support: Interacts with Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR blockchains for reading data, executing transactions, and submitting votes.

Agent-Based Modeling (ABM): Simulates complex systems with diverse agent roles (voter, signer, reader, trader, governor).

Advanced Decision-Making: Combines game theory, Markov models, and reinforcement learning, inspired by statistical physics approaches like those in Sphinx.jl.

Security: Uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for secure communication and computation.

Educational Tools: Provides tutorials and examples for learning about AI agents, swarm intelligence, and Web3 integration.

Scalability: Designed for large-scale agent networks, with efficient communication and simulation engines.

Extensibility: Modular architecture with plugins for custom agent behaviors and swarm coordination.

Architecture
Sphinx is structured into several key modules, designed for modularity and extensibility:
Agents (src/agents/): Implements different agent types (voter, signer, reader, trader, governance) with specialized roles and decision-making logic.

Core (src/core/): Defines the AIAgent class, state management, and Swarm class for swarm intelligence.

Communication (src/communication/): Provides AgentCommProtocol for decentralized, secure agent interactions.

Engine (src/engine/): Includes AgentEngine for simulation, DecisionModels for strategic decisions, and RLEngine for reinforcement learning.

Web3 (src/web3/): Integrates with blockchains via BlockchainClient, MCPClient, and Web3Tools.

Tools (src/tools/): Utilities for logging, TEE/ZKP operations, and mock Julia interfacing.

Server (src/server/): HTTP server for remote management and monitoring.

CLI (src/cli/): Command-line interface for running simulations.

The framework leverages TypeScript for type safety and modularity, ensuring a robust development experience.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js: v16 or higher  

npm: v8 or higher  

Git: For cloning the repository  

Blockchain RPC URLs: Access to Ethereum, Solana, and NEAR nodes (e.g., via Infura, Alchemy, or public RPCs)

Steps
Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/AlexSmithai/sphinx.git
cd sphinx

Install Dependencies
bash

npm install

The project depends on:  
web3: For blockchain interactions  

@tensorflow/tfjs: For neural networks and reinforcement learning  

express: For the HTTP server  

winston: For logging  

commander: For CLI functionality  

jest: For testing

Build the Project
bash

npm run build

This compiles the TypeScript code into the lib/ directory.

Configure Environment
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your blockchain RPC URLs:
env

ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
NEAR_RPC_URL=https://rpc.mainnet.near.org

Alternatively, update the RPC URLs in src/web3/web3Tools.ts.

Usage
Running a Simulation via CLI
The CLI provides a convenient way to run simulations:
bash

node lib/cli/cli.js simulate --steps 20 --agents 5

--steps: Number of simulation steps (default: 10)  

--agents: Number of agents to simulate (default: 5)  

--real-time: Run in real-time mode  

--interval: Real-time interval in milliseconds (default: 1000)

Starting the Server
Run the HTTP server to manage simulations remotely:
bash

node lib/server/server.js

The server exposes endpoints at http://localhost:3000:  
POST /start-simulation: Start a simulation (e.g., {"steps": 10} or {"simulationMode": "real-time"})  

POST /stop-simulation: Stop the current simulation  

GET /metrics: Fetch simulation metrics

Running Tests
Execute the unit tests to verify functionality:
bash

npm test

Tests are located in the test/ directory and cover core components like AIAgent and agent communication.
Tutorials
Inspired by the educational focus of Sphinx.jl, here are some tutorials to get you started with Sphinx:
Tutorial 1: Understanding Agent Decision-Making
Learn how agents make decisions using game theory and reinforcement learning:
Create a Voter Agent
typescript

import { createVoterAgent } from './src/agents/voterAgent';

const voter = createVoterAgent(1, 1, true); // Use neural network
console.log(`Created voter agent with ID ${voter.getId()}`);

Simulate a Decision
typescript

const env = { chain: 'ethereum', step: 0 };
const agents = [];
const decision = await voter.step(env, agents);
console.log(`Voter decision: ${decision}`);

Analyze Stats
typescript

const stats = voter.getAgentStats();
console.log(`Voter stats: ${JSON.stringify(stats)}`);

This tutorial demonstrates how agents use game-theoretic models and neural networks to make decisions.
Tutorial 2: Building a Custom Swarm
Create a custom swarm with multiple agent types:
Initialize Agents
typescript

import { createVoterAgent, createTradingAgent } from './src/agents';
import { Swarm } from './src/core/swarm';

const agents = [
  createVoterAgent(1, 1),
  createTradingAgent(2, 2),
];
const swarm = new Swarm('custom_swarm', agents);

Coordinate the Swarm
typescript

const env = { chain: 'ethereum', step: 0 };
await swarm.coordinate(env);
console.log(`Swarm behavior: ${JSON.stringify(swarm.analyzeEmergentBehavior())}`);

This tutorial shows how to simulate emergent behaviors in a swarm.
Examples
Basic Simulation
Run a simple simulation with the provided example:
bash

node examples/abmWeb3Simulation.js

This script sets up a simulation with 5 agents (voter, signer, reader, trader, governance) and runs for 20 steps, logging metrics at the end.
Custom Agent Implementation
Create a custom agent by extending AIAgent:
typescript

import { AIAgent, NeuralNetModel } from './src/core/agent';
import { AgentRole, ActionOutcome } from './src/agents/types';

export function createCustomAgent(id: number, priority: number = 0, useNN: boolean = false): AIAgent {
  const decisionModel = async (agent: AIAgent, env: Record<string, any>, agents: AIAgent[]): Promise<string> => {
    agent['recordAction'](env.step || 0, 'custom_action', ActionOutcome.Success, {}, 'custom');
    return 'custom_action';
  };

  return new AIAgent(id, AgentRole.Custom, decisionModel, { useNN, priority });
}

Add the agent to a simulation:
typescript

import { AgentEngine } from './src/engine/engine';
import { Swarm } from './src/core/swarm';
import { createCustomAgent } from './customAgent';

const agents = [createCustomAgent(1)];
const swarms = [new Swarm('swarm_1', agents)];
const engine = new AgentEngine(agents, swarms, { chain: 'ethereum', step: 0 });
engine.run(10);
