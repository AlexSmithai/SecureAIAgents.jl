# Sphinx.jl

A Julia framework for creating Web3-friendly AI agents with secure operations using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Inspired by the Elaria engine and Web3 AI frameworks like Eliza.

## Features
- **Web3 Integration**: Read blockchain data, submit transactions, and interact with smart contracts.
- **Advanced AI**: Neural network decision-making with Flux.jl.
- **Secure Operations**: TEEs for privacy and integrity.
- **Modular Design**: CLI, engine, server, and Web3 plugins.

## Features
- **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**: Simulate autonomous agents with historical action tracking and emergent behavior analysis.
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Agents collaborate via leader election and message passing, powered by JuliaOS.
- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**: Secure operations using simulated or real TEEs (e.g., OP-TEE on ARM TrustZone).
- **Model Context Protocol (
